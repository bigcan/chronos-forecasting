# Gemini Code Assistant Notebook Summary

## Notebook: `gold_futures_log_returns_analysis.ipynb`

This notebook provides a comprehensive analysis of forecasting gold futures prices using a log returns approach with pre-trained Chronos time-series models. The analysis is conducted on data from 2020 to 2023.

### Key Sections and Logic:

1.  **Introduction & Setup**:
    *   Highlights the benefits of using log returns (stationarity, normality, etc.) for financial time-series forecasting.
    *   Imports necessary libraries including `pandas`, `numpy`, `torch`, and the `chronos-forecasting` library. It dynamically installs missing packages like `statsmodels`.

2.  **Data Preparation & Analysis**:
    *   Loads gold futures data (`GCUSD_MAX_FROM_PERPLEXITY.csv`).
    *   Filters the data for the period from January 2020 to December 2023.
    *   Calculates log returns from the 'Close' prices.
    *   Performs statistical analysis on the log returns, including stationarity tests (ADF, KPSS) and distribution analysis (Jarque-Bera test), confirming that log returns are more stationary than absolute prices.
    *   Visualizes the price series and log returns to illustrate their different characteristics.

3.  **Zero-Shot Forecasting with Chronos**:
    *   Defines a zero-shot forecasting configuration. This is the correct approach for Chronos models as they are pre-trained and do not require fine-tuning on the target dataset.
    *   Uses multiple Chronos models (`chronos-bolt-base`, `chronos-bolt-small`).
    *   Tests various `context_windows` (63, 126, 252 days) and `prediction_horizons` (1, 3, 7 days).
    *   Implements a robust rolling-window forecasting methodology to generate a large number of predictions for statistically significant evaluation.

4.  **Results Evaluation**:
    *   Analyzes the forecasting results based on several metrics:
        *   **Return Metrics**: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
        *   **Directional Accuracy**: Hit Rate (predicting the direction of price movement).
        *   **Price Metrics**: MAE and MAPE after reconstructing prices from log returns.
    *   Identifies the best-performing model configurations based on different metrics.
    *   Performs a detailed analysis of the best configuration, including visualizations of predicted vs. actual returns and prices.

5.  **Comparative Analysis**:
    *   Compares the performance of the log returns approach against a baseline absolute price forecasting model (results loaded from `phase1_final_comparison_results.csv`).
    *   The analysis shows that while the log returns approach might have a higher absolute price error, it often provides superior directional accuracy, which is crucial for trading strategies.

6.  **FEV Benchmarking Integration**:
    *   The notebook includes a section to integrate with the `fev` (Forecasting Evaluation) library for standardized benchmarking.
    *   It prepares the dataset and model predictions in the format required for submission to the FEV leaderboard on Hugging Face Spaces.
    *   This demonstrates how to compare the custom model against a wider set of standard benchmarks in the community.

7.  **Conclusion & Outputs**:
    *   The analysis concludes that the log returns approach with Chronos models is a viable strategy, particularly for directional forecasting.
    *   Saves the detailed results, including the best model configuration and FEV-ready data, to the `./results/` directory.

This notebook is a well-structured and thorough example of applying modern, pre-trained time-series models to financial forecasting, emphasizing proper evaluation techniques like zero-shot rolling windows and standardized benchmarking.
