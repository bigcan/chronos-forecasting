# Zero-Shot Log Returns Forecasting Analysis Results

## Executive Summary

This analysis evaluates Chronos models for gold futures log returns forecasting using proper zero-shot methodology. The results reveal significant insights about model performance, limitations, and potential applications.

## Key Findings

### 🎯 **CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED: Extremely Limited Sample Sizes**

**Major Problem**: Despite implementing proper zero-shot methodology to use the full dataset, the actual forecasting results show severe sample size limitations:

- **Expected**: 700-900+ forecasts per configuration
- **Actual**: Only 1-7 forecasts executed 
- **Data Utilization**: <1% of available data used

### 📊 **Performance Analysis**

#### **Best Configuration**
```
Model: chronos_bolt_small
Context Window: 63 days  
Prediction Horizon: 7 days
Hit Rate: 71.4% (5/7 correct predictions)
Return MAE: 0.00896
Price MAE: $31.60
```

#### **Performance by Horizon**
- **1-day horizon**: 0% hit rate (all wrong predictions)
- **3-day horizon**: 66.7% hit rate (2/3 correct)
- **7-day horizon**: 71.4% hit rate (5/7 correct)

#### **Model Comparison**
- **chronos_bolt_base**: Avg hit rate 46.0%
- **chronos_bolt_small**: Avg hit rate 46.1% (marginal difference)

### ⚠️ **Statistical Reliability Issues**

#### **Sample Size Problems**
- **Minimum viable**: 30+ forecasts for basic statistical significance
- **Actual sample sizes**: 1-7 forecasts per configuration
- **Statistical power**: Extremely low - results not reliable

#### **Hit Rate Analysis**
- **1-day predictions**: 0/18 configurations beat random (50%)
- **Multi-day predictions**: Some show promise but sample sizes too small
- **Best apparent performance**: 71.4% (but only 7 samples)

### 💰 **Price Accuracy**
- **Best Price MAE**: $16.35 (3-day horizon, 252-day context)
- **Price MAPE range**: 0.90% - 1.75%
- **Volatility prediction**: Very poor (ratios near 0.01-0.03)

## Root Cause Analysis

### 🔍 **Why So Few Forecasts?**

The discrepancy between expected (~900) and actual (1-7) forecasts suggests:

1. **Implementation Error**: Loop termination or data access issues
2. **Memory Constraints**: Models running out of memory
3. **Error Handling**: Silent failures reducing sample count
4. **Data Indexing**: Incorrect array slicing

### 📉 **Performance Patterns**

1. **Horizon Effect**: Longer horizons perform better (counterintuitive)
2. **Context Effect**: Minimal impact across 63-252 day contexts
3. **Model Effect**: No significant difference between base/small models

## Comparison with Absolute Price Approach

### **Log Returns vs Price-Based Results**
```
Metric                  | Log Returns | Price-Based | Winner
------------------------|-------------|-------------|--------
Sample Size             | 1-7         | 100+        | Price
Hit Rate (best)         | 71.4%*      | 53.3%       | Log*
Price MAE (best)        | $16.35      | $15.16      | Price
Statistical Reliability | Very Low    | High        | Price
```
*Based on tiny sample size

## Recommendations

### 🚨 **Immediate Actions Required**

1. **DEBUG FORECASTING LOOP**
   - Investigate why only 1-7 forecasts execute
   - Fix data access or memory issues
   - Ensure full dataset utilization

2. **INCREASE SAMPLE SIZES**
   - Target minimum 100+ forecasts per configuration
   - Use shorter context windows if needed
   - Implement batch processing for memory efficiency

3. **VALIDATE IMPLEMENTATION**
   - Compare with absolute price approach methodology
   - Verify rolling window logic
   - Test on smaller dataset first

### 🎯 **Strategic Insights**

#### **If Results Valid (Post-Fix)**
- **Longer horizons** may be more predictable for log returns
- **Context window** has minimal impact (63-252 days similar)
- **Model size** doesn't significantly affect performance

#### **Current State Assessment**
- ❌ **Not production ready** due to sample size issues
- ❌ **Statistically unreliable** results
- ⚠️ **Methodology correct** but implementation flawed

### 🔄 **Next Steps**

1. **Fix Implementation**: Debug and resolve sampling issues
2. **Re-run Analysis**: Generate statistically robust results
3. **Compare Approaches**: Validate against price-based methodology
4. **Production Deployment**: Only after achieving reliable sample sizes

## Technical Specifications

- **Dataset**: Gold futures 2020-2023 (1,031 trading days)
- **Models**: ChronosBolt Base & Small (Amazon/HuggingFace)
- **Evaluation**: Zero-shot rolling window methodology
- **Configurations**: 18 total (2 models × 3 contexts × 3 horizons)
- **Target Sample Size**: 700-900+ forecasts per configuration
- **Actual Sample Size**: 1-7 forecasts per configuration ⚠️

## Conclusion

While the zero-shot methodology is theoretically sound and shows promising directional accuracy (71.4% best case), the extremely limited sample sizes render the results statistically unreliable. **Critical implementation debugging is required** before any production deployment or meaningful comparison with other approaches.

The log returns approach shows potential for **longer-horizon forecasting** but needs substantial technical fixes to realize its full analytical potential.
