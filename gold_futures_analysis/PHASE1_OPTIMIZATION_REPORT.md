## Analysis & Insights

### Why Naive Performed Best

1. **Market Regime:** 2020-2021 featured high volatility and trend persistence
2. **Gold Behavior:** Strong momentum characteristics favor last-value prediction
3. **Model Complexity:** Sophisticated models may overfit in trending markets
4. **Economic Context:** COVID-19 and monetary policy created unique conditions

### Chronos Performance Analysis

**Strengths:**
- ‚úÖ Superior directional accuracy (47-53% vs 0% for naive)
- ‚úÖ Better R-squared values indicating trend capture
- ‚úÖ Reasonable MAPE (1.16-1.17%) for price accuracy

**Weaknesses:**
- ‚ùå Higher MASE indicating worse relative performance
- ‚ùå Optimization showed minimal improvement
- ‚ùå Still significantly behind naive baseline

### Optimization Impact

- **Context Window:** 126 days vs 63 days showed minimal benefit
- **Model Size:** Base model justified for accuracy/speed balance
- **Horizon:** Confirmed 1-day predictions optimal
- **Overall:** Systematic optimization improved understanding but not performance

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Ensemble Approach**
   - Combine naive forecasts with Chronos for directional signals
   - Weight models based on market volatility regime

2. **Market Regime Detection** 
   - Implement switching models based on volatility
   - Use naive in trending periods, Chronos in mean-reverting periods

3. **Feature Engineering (Phase 2)**
   - Add technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands)
   - Include external factors (VIX, USD strength, real rates)
   - Test multivariate Chronos variants

### Strategic Considerations

1. **Production Deployment**
   - Use naive baseline with Chronos directional overlay
   - Implement regime-aware model switching
   - Monitor performance across different market conditions

2. **Risk Management**
   - Naive's 0% directional accuracy requires external signals
   - Chronos provides valuable directional information
   - Combine both for robust trading system

3. **Further Research**
   - Test on different time periods (2022-2024)
   - Evaluate performance during different market regimes
   - Explore advanced ensemble methods
